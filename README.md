# Project-Euler-answers-in-python
Hello folks, Are you a beginner in Python and trying to solve basic functions to improve your python knowledge and try testing yourself with Hackerrank or some other platforms to create a basic portfolio? then this repo might help you in right sense.

Questions taken from Project Euler Archives and addressed the piece of codes in Python.


**#Q1 - If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.**

```python
def sum_of_multiples_of_3_or_5(max_limit):
    a = 0
    for i in range(1,max_limit):
        if i%3 or i%5:
            a += i
    print("Sum of multiples of 3/5 till {} is {}".format(max_limit,a))
```

**#Q2 - Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ... By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.**

```python

def sum_of_even_valued_fibonacci():
    i=int(input("sum of fibonacci sequence value = "))
    a ,b = 1,2
    x = 0
    while b<i:
        if b%2 == 0:
            x += b
        a,b = b,a+b
    print("sum of even valued Fibonacci Sequence terms is:",x)

```
